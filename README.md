# Time Series Forecasting for Bitcoin Prices

## Description
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to time series analysis and forecasting for Bitcoin daily prices. Users will learn how to manipulate and prepare time series data, build and compare different forecasting models, and evaluate the results to determine the most suitable approach for forecasting Bitcoin prices.

## Key Features
- **Data Manipulation:** Learn to effectively manipulate and prepare time series data for analysis, including sorting and structuring the data.
- **Model Building:** Experiment with various time series forecasting models, such as ARIMA, exponential smoothing, linear regression, and neural networks.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and MAPE to assess forecast accuracy.
- **Residual Analysis:** Conduct residual analysis to identify patterns or systematic errors in the models and refine forecasting strategies accordingly.
